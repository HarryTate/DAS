<p>
<strong>Search Rescue -</strong> This allows it to cover vast areas in a single flight,
searching more area than any one group of people would be capable of. Search patterns and full autopilot controls can be developed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fire Fighting â€“ </strong>Will give the fire brigade a images to quickly and effectively scout out dangerous fires, observe and monitor a large blaze and the surrounding area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Disaster Response - </strong>To help determine the areas needing urgent support, allowing government services and aid agencies to deploy their teams and resources where they can make the biggest impact. As rescue slowly moves to recovery, aerial systems can be used to create 3D maps and models that illustrate exactly where and to what extent an area has been damaged.
