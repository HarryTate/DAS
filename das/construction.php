<strong>Real Estate Marketing-</strong> Aerial photos and videos allow properties to be showcased in new and creative ways. Combined with indoor photography, realtors are now able to arm themselves with creative tools that were only available to the largest of projects in the past. Prospective buyers could measure out areas for specific features they might want to place on their lawns. A 3D model can be generated from photographs to allow individuals to experience the architecture in new and unique ways. Experiencing properties in more interactive ways allows agents to help clients better envisage how a property meets the needs of client.

<p>
<strong>Site Mapping - </strong>Site managers can regularly map their site to stay informed on individual task progress, preventing large change orders before they happen.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Building Inspection -</strong> Reduce building inspection teams and the need for clambering along walls, walking across rooftops and the construction of scaffolding.
With problem areas identified and evaluated in advance, repairs can be carried out more quickly and efficiently.
