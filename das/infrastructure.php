  <strong>  Transportation -</strong> Using photogrammetry apps, allowing for the recovery of exact positions of surface points from aerial images captured by our drones. This information can be quickly processed through customized software to create centimetre accurate 2D and maps, as well as 3D virtual models that can be explored as if in the space.
     They also can also be used to monitor traffic flows this could help minimize congestion and eliminate accident and traffic hotspots.

<p>
<strong>Mining -</strong>  Rapid surveying with ground control points (GCPs) allow for 1cm accuracy data capture. Automated stockpile calculation and slope grading provides invaluable real world data on operational output, as well as equipment fuel consumption costs in quarries.
  Surveying - Our platforms allow us to quickly collect geo-referenced aerial images. The geo-tag images with GPS information which can be processed with photogrammetry to produce point clouds and digital terrain models.
