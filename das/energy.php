  <strong>Wind -</strong>
  Conducting wind turbine inspections using drones is a significant improvement over existing methods. They are able to fly precisely and accurately in close proximity to the turbine, taking away the need to put people at risk.
The high resolution imagery, 16 megapixel photos and 4K video, ideal for identifying fissures, cracks, or other indicators of structural stresses that may require repair. As all the data is stored on-board, it can be reviewed either at the point of inspection, or back at the office. These innovations allow inspection teams to increase their overall efficiency while reducing facility downtime.

  <strong>Oil & Gas - </strong> Droneâ€™s allow for even the largest facilities to be inspected quickly from the air.
   They provide simple, high altitude facility surveying as well as close proximity vertical inspection.

<p>
<strong>Nuclear -</strong> Nuclear materials also present serious safety risks to inspection staff, strengthening the case for remote solutions.
   Using drones for inspections in these situations allows the work to be carried out more quickly than traditional methods.
